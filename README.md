## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox tools

### What I learned
I revised the workflow of building responsive website using HTML5 and CSS. Helped me recall the usage of basic CSS properties like border-radius and padding, and reinforce my knowledge. 

### Continued development
I would love to continue focusing on more CSS frameworks like flexbox and grid for better positioning and enhancing responsiveness. 
Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources
- Resource 1(https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/figma-developers-guide/) & (https://www.learnwithjason.dev/introduction-to-figma-for-developers) - This is an amazing article along with a youtube video resource which helped me understand Figma a lot better. I'd recommend it to developers beginning to understand Figma design tools and interface.
